## How to use the Calculator
Target is every stable version having a refernce to a colab link, not needing any locally set up. 
  
For now if you want to check it up you need a python IDE and numpy and ipy widgets installed packages in order to run Calculator.ipynb cell by cell. 
 
## Last Version info
This is a project format testing version. None a physical size it's true. Every result its symbolic.
## Things that may I have to care about

We have do discuss which values are acceptable, what kind of ages, bmis, enviroments etc are supported.
1. Because, bmi of course is not characteristic for all ages (ex infants), maybe mass is more characteristic measurement? 
2. The human models are only for, there are not a lot of exceptions? (there are more it'is models with big differences)
3. Is there any approximation that we have to do for situations that we don't have values? like indoor for ex.  
*an idea: We can make some approximations with make some data analysis of free data about every exception that we can find*
4. Do we want to calculate our precision and inform the user about that?
*For example is its 30% measurement error and 10% error from the method, for a person exactly on our human model (ex. duke) 24 hours
at a place we have take measurements, we have an (+-)36.40% result. What is happening with cases that we have to do a lot of in accordance approximations? *
